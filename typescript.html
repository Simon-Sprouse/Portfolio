        <h2>What is typescript?</h2>
        <p>Typescript is a compiled language that turns high level code into JavaScript. Technically, turning one language into another high-level language is known as trans-piling.  Typescript is managed under the npm package manager. Much like c/c++, typescript code must be compiled using the command line. </p>
        <h2>What are the advantages of using typescript for javascript?</h2>
        <p>Typescript offers several benefits over the traditional JavaScript. The most obvious is the inclusion of the ability to define types â€“ hence the name. I think the largest benefit for a beginner user, such as myself, is the additional layer of error checking that the typescript compiler offers. I was actually able to catch a potential logic error while compiling my typescript code. </p>
