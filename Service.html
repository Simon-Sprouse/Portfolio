            <h2>Being an TA</h2>
            <p>Maybe it’s not obvious just how being a teaching assistant can count as service, but I really try to take it the extra mile and work beyond what I get paid to do. I often stay after class with students to help them learn, even though I don’t need to do so. As any teacher will readily tell you, there is so much more going on behind the scenes than you would initially suspect. Even though it’s tough I love giving back to the younger students and helping them on their path.</p>
            <h2>Ending World Hunger</h2>
            <p>I would love to end world hunger if I had enough money. I really think world hunger is like messed up to the point of non-sense. I think statistically there is more than enough food and water to account for all of the needs of mankind, and lack of these resources is almost entirely attributed to government/economic action. If I had enough power, maybe I could put a stop to this. </p>
