                <h2>Why Data Science?</h2>
                <p>
                    In a distant and magical land, where the Truffula Trees once stood tall and vibrant and the Bar-ba-Loots happily roamed, the story of the Lorax unfolds. It begins with a young boy embarking on a quest to discover the truth about the place he now finds barren and lifeless. The once-colorful landscape has faded, and the boy is intrigued to learn what led to this desolation.

                <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    As he explores the area, the boy encounters a peculiar figure known as the Once-ler, who resides in a small, crumbling shack. The Once-ler's tale unravels the mystery behind the environmental decline. He starts his story by recalling a time when the land was abundant with Truffula Trees, the source of Thneeds, versatile and highly sought-after objects. The Once-ler's entrepreneurial spirit drove him to set up a factory and begin harvesting the Truffula Trees, ignoring the warnings of a small, orange, mustached guardian called the Lorax, who "speaks for the trees."

                <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    Through these initial paragraphs, the reader is introduced to the central themes of environmental conservation and the consequences of unchecked greed. The young boy's journey to uncover the Lorax's story serves as the narrative thread that weaves together the lessons of responsibility and stewardship of the natural world, themes that remain relevant and impactful today.
